        lyrics : `Well she was an American girl 
                  Raised on promises
                  She couldn't help thinkin' that there
                  Was a little more to life
                  Somewhere else
                  After all it was a great big world
                  With lots of places to run to
                  Yeah, and if she had to die tryin'
                  She had one little promise
                  She was gonna keep
                  Oh yeah, alright
                  Take it easy baby
                  Make it last all night
                  She was an American girl
                  Well, it was kind of cold that night
                  She stood alone on her balcony
                  Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
                  Out on 441
                  Like waves crashin' on the beach
                  And for one…`

                  I need a date to the prom
                  Would you like to come along
                  But nobody would go to the prom with me baby

                And maybe they'd be happy for a while
                But February made me shiver
                With every paper I'd deliver

                Bad news on the doorstep
                I couldn't take one more step
                I can't remember if I cried
                When I read about his widowed bride
                Something touched me deep inside
                The day the music died

                  Sail on the horizons gotta landfall rendezvous
                  Captain steers a well-known course, he steers straight & true
                  As he trims the sheets, he sings a song
                  He learned on boats and bars

                  Sailor spends his Christmas in a harbour 'neath the stars
                  He's traveled through the doldrums, typhoons and hurricanes
                  He's logged a million soggy miles with water on his brain
                  But Christmas is the season better suited for dry land
                  He'll tell some lies, meet some spies
                  And dance barefoot in the sand
                  The sailor spends his Christmas in a harbour on the hook
                  Caye con les, no work today, let's shell the ol' log book
                  The waterfront is reveling, the season has begun

                  The sailor spends his Christmas in a harbour having fun.
                  There's a party down at Le Selecte, music, rum and cheers
                  Faces…`

                  Tell me are you a badfish too?

                  Are you a badfish too?
                  Ain't got no money to spend

                  Lord knows I'm weak
                  Won't somebody get me off of this reef
                  Baby you're a big blue whale
                  Grab the reef when all duck diving fails

                  I swim, but wish I'd never learned
                  The water's too polluted with the germs
                  I dive deep when it's ten feet overhead
